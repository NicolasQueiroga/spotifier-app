First, checkout to `local` and install dependencies:

And then, run the development server:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Deploy URL
To use Spotifier, I will need to register your email linked with spotify at the API dashboard app (n.macielqueiroga@gmail.com), and it is required to allow `Insecure content` within the browser, so that requests to the deployed Django Rest API are accepted.
